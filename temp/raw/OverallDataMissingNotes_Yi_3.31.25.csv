She endorsed depressed mood more than half the days, but endorsed anhedonia nearly every day in the past two weeks. She also endorsed overeating, fatigue/anergia, and worthlessness nearly every day, as well as insomnia. When asked if she's ever had a two-week period where she felt depressed or down nearly every day, she said she hadn't, but she has been anhedonic for long enough to constitute an episode. This episode began 3 years ago, and she said she was in remission for at least 2 months prior to that. She has a psychiatrist but said he seemed uninterested in participating in the study, and would prefer for us to work with her PCP.   Suicidality/Protective Factors: No suicidality. No access to guns, does not stockpile medication. She does have chronic pain (primarily from the psoriatic arthritis), but says she is not under a lot of stress, and that she has several good friends that she confides in.

No period of remission since this episode began in 2007. In the past two weeks, she has had low mood, insomnia, psychomotor retardation, fatigue/anergia, and concentration problems nearly every day, and anhedonia more than half the days. The episode was triggered by her siblings accusing her of stealing from and poisoning their mother in 2007 when Veronica had placed her in a long-term care facility due to dementia. Things are moderately better now, and two of her sisters have come to 'her side' and now provide social support.    Suicidality/Protective Factors: No suicidality. She is feeling hopeless and has chronic pain, but she says she has no desire to die, and her main reason for living is because her siblings wish she was dead.

I suggest she continue the same meds.  Tell her that we will be talking to the patient every 4 months for the next year, and we will remind her to get blood work over the next year with pended orders and we will help to interpret the labs.  For now, I think we should probably get another Bun/Cr, TSH, and lithium level, as we won't be talking with her for another 4 months.

However she still has 'no get up and go'.  She tends to lay in bed a lot.  Her motivation very low.  She stated 'I am not sure if it is lack of motivation, pain, depression or just laziness).  Her chronic pain makes household chores difficult.  She would still like to find a job rather than go on disability but the job search has been frustrating as she is limited in what she would be able to do.   Her sleep is still a daily problem.  She is taking OTC 10mg melatonin at night and this does help her to stay asleep and she does feel more rested but she still reports daily sleep difficulties which fluctuates between DFA/SCD and sleeping excessively.   She does have considerable shakiness in both of her hands but this will reduce with concentration.  She also reported that over the past 2 weeks her gums have started receding and bleeding and they are swollen & painful.  She reports only occasional dry mouth.

The script for 450mg (3 tabs of 150mg) was expensive (she reports @ $700).  Therefore, to make the script last longer she reduced to taking 2 tabs/day = 300mg daily.  She did this around the beginning of November (probably around 11/9/18 as she told OP-Neuro she stopped taking it on 11/7/18.  She reported to me she only stopped taking it for 2 days, then decided she needed something to help her during this stressful time.      Email update to Dr. Karp on 12/3/18- Step 1 Month 4- The script for 450mg Wellbutrin (3 tabs of 150mg) was expensive (she reports @ $700).  Therefore, to make the script last longer she reduced to taking 2 tabs/day = 300mg daily.  I did mention to look into GoodRx to help reduce costs.  Regardless, she isn't sure if she would want to return to 450mg.  She did this around the beginning of November (probably around 11/9/18 as she told OP-Neuro she stopped taking it on 11/7/18 and reported to me she only stopped taking it for 2 days, then decided she needed something to help her during this stressful time).  Continues to have side-effect of mild constipation, Miralax was helpful in managing.  PHQ-9 = 9 (score was 5 on 8/21/18 at and extra support call).  Stressors include deciding to resign in September (it was a sudden and unhappy parting) resulting in struggling with arranging healthcare, searching for new employment, and financial concerns.  Overall she feels her mood is up & down.  Most frequently endorsed symptom is trouble concentrating/focusing (she reports loosing things, forgetting things).  Although daily functioning is not greatly impacted, it is bothersome to her.  She feels that currently anxiety (feeling scattered, irritable, and agitated/fidgety) is more of a struggle than issues with mood.

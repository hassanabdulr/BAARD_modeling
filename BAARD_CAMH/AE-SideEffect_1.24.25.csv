On a phone call with a study RA on Friday, December 8th at 3:50pm ET the participant reported that from Saturday December 2nd to Sunday December 3rd she was hospitalized at the Montefiore Medical Center located in Bronx, NY due to nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that had been going on for about 3 days. According to the inpatient discharge summary, the patient also reported increased urinary frequency with burning at urination, lower abdominal pain, and feeling of incomplete voiding. The report indicates that the patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (likely gastroenteritis) improved with bowel rest, Zofran, IVF, and diet as tolerated. Workup of urinary symptoms revealed no UTI and retention (all PVRs <200cc). The participant was discharged on December 3rd, 2017 and instructed to follow up with her primary care provider regarding urinary symptoms.     The patient returned to the clinic on December 11, 2017 for follow up and to determine whether medication adjustment was required. The patient reported to have continued taking the study medication, 50mg Nortriptyline during her inpatient stay and after discharge. During the visit, the patient reported that her GI symptoms were much improved. Her mood was low (PHQ-9 of 14) which she attributed to flulike symptoms and the holiday season approaching as this is her first holiday since her mother's passing.     It is our impression that the hospitalization was not related to the study medication.

The patient has a pacemaker and is currently treated for atrial fibrillation by her primary care doctor. The patient's sister reported to the study team via phone call on 5/11/18 that her sister was hospitalized at New York Presbyterian on 5/8/18 for heart palpitations. She was unaware of when the patient would be discharged. The NYP EMR system notes report that the patient was admitted on 5/8/18 and discharged on 5/11/18. Per the EMR notes, the patient's heart rate was monitored during her time in the hospital. Her pacemaker was determined to be operating normally. She was instructed to increase her Diltiazem from 120mg to 240mg and was observed for two nights. On the morning of 5/10/18, the patient reported that her heart palpitations had decreased. She was discharged on 5/11/18 with instructions to increase her Diltiazem dose to 240mg daily, and decrease her Rivaroxaban dose from 20mg to 15mg daily. She was also given the following diet restrictions: 'Avoid added salt, canned vegetables, pre-made soups/entrees and salted snacks.' The patient has a follow-up appointment with her primary care doctor on 5/24/18.     On 5/14/18, the patient returned to the ER reporting that her heart palpitations had returned. Her EKG and laboratory results were within normal limits. The doctor encouraged the patient and her family to follow-up with a cardiologist. The patient was then discharged from the ER later that day. It is the impression of the study team that the hospitalization was not related to the study medication.

This patient was evaluated on 02/06/2019. At evaluation, the patient reported a PHQ-9 of 12. She listed the following medical conditions: sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, occasional headaches, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, joint pain, urinary incontinence and her current medications were: Rivaroxaban 20mg, Ranitidine 150mg, Prednisone 5mg, Metoprolol 50mg, Atorvastatin 80mg, Pregabalin 75mg, and Melatonin 10mg, and Paxil 30 mg. Her blood pressure was 149/67, pulse 58, with no abnormalities found on her bloodwork or EKG that were collected at this time (see recent blood work and EKG attached below). This patient enrolled into the OPTIMUM study on 02/06/2019 and was randomized to Aripiprazole augmentation to Paroxetine 30mg.  For the first 6 weeks of the protocol, the patient scored PHQ-9's of 3 (a value indicative of remission of depressive symptoms), stating that she was adhering to the medication regimen of Paroxetine 30mg and Aripiprazole 2mg and she reported no side effects or medical issues. At Week 8 (05/07/2019), the patient self-discontinued Aripiprazole due to worsening anxiety, agitation and weight gain. She reported cutting pills of Paroxetine to increase her dose of 30 mg, and it was assumed she was now taking roughly 40 mg daily. The patient was due to return to clinic in May for her Week 10 visit, but was unable to be reached to schedule an appointment. On 6/12/2019, the patient came to clinic with complaints of worsening depression, PHQ-9 = 19 on Paroxetine appx 40mg (taking a 30mg tab plus a partial tablet). She stated that she was also cutting Alprazolam pills that were prescribed by her psychiatrist, Dr. Balta, in 2019 and taking partial doses of these cut pills. Dr. Bret Rutherford spoke to this patient on 6/17/2019 due to reports of suicidality, but patient was deemed safe and was scheduled to return the next day for randomization to Step 2. On 6/18/2019, the patient was randomized to switch to Nortriptyline. She was instructed to taper off Paroxetine over 4 days and begin Nortriptyline 25mg after Paroxetine taper. The patient was also told to discontinue the short-acting Alprazolam and substitute it with long-acting Ativan 0.5mg twice a day as needed for severe anxiety. On 6/26/2019, the Nortriptyline dose increased to 50mg. At Step 2 Week 2 (7/10/2019), the patient reported adherence to Nortriptyline 50mg and scored a PHQ-9 of 9, and reported feeling much better. Her Nortriptyline blood level was drawn. One week after, on 7/11/2019, the patient came in for a follow-up visit and scored a PHQ-9 of 11. On 7/15/2019 the patient's Nortriptyline blood level was reported to be 100 ng/mL (therapeutic level is 80-120 ng/mL). At Step 2 Week 4 (7/18/2019), the patient scored a PHQ-9 of 11. She was seen with their husband and a Spanish-speaking interpreter. Patient reported seeing their cardiologist Dr. Stefano Ravalli on Monday 7/15/2019 for a regular follow-up appointment and stated that he told them to stop taking Nortriptyline. On Tuesday 7/16/2019 the patient took Nortriptyline 25mg and on Wednesday 7/17/2019 she took no antidepressant medication. Dr. Ravalli also directed patient to increase the Metoprolol from 50mg to 75mg. On Wednesday afternoon (7/17/2019), the patient went to the Emergency Department (unclear which one) because she did not feel well; She had an EKG, was not provided any new medications, and she was sent home with instructions to come to her next appointment at our clinic on 7/18/2019.  On July 18th, 2019 during the clinic visit, the patient endorsed sadness, anxiety, and some dizziness. At her appointment, there was a Spanish-speaking interpreter and her husband present. The patient's blood pressure was taken using the automated machine and was 179/86, Heart Rate: 94 bpm, at which point she reported chest pressure, headache, and dizziness. A repeated manual blood pressure reading was done by Galit Marcus, NP and was 183/103, Heart Rate: 106 bpm. At this point the patient lost consciousness for about 5-6 seconds while seated, with steady and strong breathing and pulse. After about 5-6 seconds, she regained consciousness. There was no evidence of any seizure activity. The patient was oriented to person and place, and answered questions appropriately with single word answers (per Spanish-speaker interpreter). Additionally, no asymmetry, CN II-XII grossly intact. After initiating the emergency protocol, which included calling security and eliciting help from the attending medical staff, the clinical team stayed by the patient's side until EMS picked her up within approximately 15 minutes. The patient was accompanied to Emergency Department by her husband. We spoke with New York Presbyterian Emergency Department and were informed the patient was being medically admitted.  Galit Marcus NP spoke with Dr. Ina Becker, a psychiatry attending doctor at New York Presbyterian who gave the patient's medical and psychiatric history, requested CL consult and possible psychiatric hospitalization for medication stabilization once she is medically stable. Dr. Becker agreed to CL consult and to evaluate whether the patient meets criteria for psychiatric admission. In addition to speaking with Dr, Becker, Galit Marcus NP also spoke to Dr. Stefano Ravalli, the patient's cardiologist. According to her cardiologist, the patient was first referred to him in May of 2018 for shortness of breath. At that time, he started her on Metoprolol for tachycardia and referred them to pulmonology for borderline pulmonary HTN. He did not start the patient on Rivaroxaban, and does not know who wrote the first prescription. The patient had a CT-angiogram in November 2017 that was normal and an echocardiogram in December 2018 that was normal. Patient was seen again in March 2019, and he reported no change in her status. On the cardiologist appointment on July 15, 2019, the patient was tachycardic with a blood pressure of 140/90, Heart Rate: 102. According to the patient, this was a scheduled follow-up appointment with her cardiologist. Dr. Ravalli stated that he thought this might be secondary to the Nortriptyline. He said he did not tell the patient to stop Nortriptyline, but suggested that she consider a second opinion for psychiatric medication management, and possibly re-start Paroxetine. Dr. Ravalli did not feel there were any acute cardiac issues.  We will follow-up with the patient's medical and psychiatric team at CUMC and remain in contact with the patient and her family.

Confirmed positive,4/10/2020,6/10/2020,"On 4/10/2020, the study RA called the patient to schedule an upcoming phone call and reached the patient's husband. Her husband explained that after 2 weeks of worsening depressive and physiological symptoms, she was taken to New York-Presbyterian/The Allen Hospital in an ambulance around 12:00PM on 4/10/2020. He explained that in the past two weeks the patient's appetite was severely low (eating less than half of a sandwich and drinking a cup of milk a day) and that she has not gotten out of the bed for any reason or speak to him or her children. The patient also developed mild breathing difficulties and mild fevers ranging between 99.8°Fon 3/29/2020 to 101.17°F on 4/10/2020. After speaking with the patient's primary care provider on the morning of 4/10/2020, the husband was instructed to call 911. According to the husband, the patient's primary care provider suggested calling 911 because they were 'worried about the depressive symptoms and newfound physiological symptoms'. The patient's husband was not allowed to go to the hospital with the patient given the restrictive COIVD-19 regulations and has not been provided any updates from the hospital. We will be in continuous contact with the patient's husband regarding any new details about the patient. We do not have enough information at this moment to deem if this adverse event was related to study medications. It is the teams impression that this patient may have contracted COVID-19.",Resolved,"The patient is a Spanish-speaking 71 year-old female with a history of recurrent major depression who previously failed anti-depressant trials of Fluoxetine 40mg and Paroxetine 40mg. This patient was evaluated on 02/06/2019. At evaluation, the patient reported a PHQ-9 of 12. She listed the following medical conditions: sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, occasional headaches, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, joint pain, urinary incontinence and her current medications were: Rivaroxaban 20mg, Ranitidine 150mg, Prednisone 5mg, Metoprolol 50mg, Atorvastatin 80mg, Pregabalin 75mg, and Melatonin 10mg, and Paxil 30 mg. This patient enrolled into the OPTIMUM study on 02/06/2019 and was randomized to aripiprazole augmentation to paroxetine 30mg.    The patient was in remission during the first 6 weeks of the Step 1 acute phase, evidenced by PHQ-9's of 3. She was adherent to Paroxetine 30mg and aripiprazole 2mg and she reported no side effects or medical issues. At Week 8, the patient self-discontinued aripiprazole 2mg due to worsening anxiety, agitation and weight gain. Since her depression returned, she then entered Step 2 on 6/18/19 and was randomized to switch to nortriptyline. She was adherent to nortriptyline 25mg until 7/17/2019, when her cardiologist told her to discontinue nortriptyline 25mg. At that point, the patient restarted paroxetine 40mg and aripiprazole 2mg. Any changes to her anti-depressant regimen were put on hold due to a left hand tremor that began on 9/4/2019. While it was possible that the aripiprazole 2mg was the cause of the tremor, when the aripiprazole 2mg was discontinued on 10/3/2019, the tremor persisted. Thus, until her tremor is examined by a neurologist, we made the decision to keep her on paroxetine 40mg QD, bupropion 150mg QD, and lorazepam 1mg PRN. She continues expressing depressive symptoms and scored a PHQ-9 of 18 on 3/25/2020. We have heavily emphasized the importance of the neurologist follow-up but her appointment has now been postponed twice due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It is the teams impression that the tremor is not related to study medications.",Not likely related,No,"No, it is an Unexpected AE",,No Change to Study Med,,No,Yes,Hospitalization - initial or prolonged,,,,Complete

Procedure:         Pre-Anesthesia Assessment:                     - The risks and benefits of the procedure and the                      sedation options and risks were discussed with the                      patient. All questions were answered and informed                      consent was obtained.                     After an appropriate timeout was performed, the                      patient was identified and procedure was verified.                      After I obtained informed consent, the colonoscope                      was passed under direct vision. Throughout the                      procedure, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and                      oxygen saturations were monitored continuously. The                      CF- HQ190L 2513574 was introduced through the anus                      and advanced up to the terminal ileum. The                      colonoscopy was performed without difficulty. The                      patient tolerated the procedure well. The quality of                      the bowel preparation was adequate.  Findings:          A scattered area of mildly erythematous mucosa was                      found in the sigmoid colon. Biopsies were taken with                      a cold forceps for histology.                     Biopsies for histology were taken with a cold                      forceps for evaluation of microscopic colitis.                     The terminal ileum appeared normal. Biopsies were                      taken with a cold forceps for histology.  Impression:        - Erythematous mucosa in the sigmoid colon. Biopsied.                     - The examined portion of the ileum was normal.                      Biopsied.                     - Biopsies were taken with a cold forceps for                      evaluation of microscopic colitis.  Recommendation:    - Admit the patient to hospital ward for ongoing                      care.                     - Continue present medications.                     - The findings and

They admitted him for 4 days for treatment and observation, determining he had possible pneumonia and pleural effusions, neither related to either bupropion or aripiprazole treatment.     Hospital Course      Patient is a 64-year-old male who was recently at the  hospital, admitted on March 23, found to have a pancolitis, had diarrhea,  he did improve, also found to have COPD, discharged home on March 27.   Following this he did develop, per patient report, pneumonia.  He was given  10 days of antibiotic. He began  to throw up some small chunks of blood.  He indicates he gradually got  increased shortness of breath.  Upon interview in the Emergency Room, he  was noted to be on oxygen at 2 liters.  He indicates that he is feeling  better on that oxygen.  During the workup, he was also noted to have  bilateral pleural effusion.  Per records, there is also bilateral  pneumonitis for which he did receive antibiotics while in the Emergency  Room.  Currently, he does continue to complain of shortness of breath.  He  denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or chest pain.  He did have a  bedside echocardiogram done, which did show no pericardial effusion.     The patient's problem list while here in the hospital included the following last updated on the day of discharge:     1.

Nausea was reported at baseline.  On 3/16/18 at the 8 month continuation call she reports continued nausea which she feels is related to the Trintellix.  It has lessed a bit in severity since she contacted OPTIMUM on 2/15/18 but is still present.  Therefore, she plans to discontinue Trintellix 10mg.

She reports that last week she was hospitalized for an ischemic stroke. It's not clear where she was hospitalized: we do not have access to medical records related to this event. She reports feeling like something wasn't right and slurring her speech. She says her daughter took her to the hospital and they admitted her 11/21/17 and discharged her 11/23/17. She used the words 'ischemic stroke' when she said what they told her she had. She said they're doing some follow-up to see if she has an arrhythmia that is throwing clots and may have a cardioverter implanted. She'll be following up with a cardiologist next month and with her PCP this week. ,Resolved,"UPDATE 12/1/17: She followed up with her PCP, who confirmed the event and that she was admitted to Jefferson Hospital, which is why we don't have records. Here's the text of his note:    This is a very pleasant 69-year-old female with past medical history of stroke in 1995 and multiple episodes of TIAs after that came to the office for follow-up after recent hospitalization, where she was admitted to Jefferson Hospital on 21/11/2017 because of TIA. In the morning of that day she had what it seems like Broka's aphasia. Workup during last hospitalization was unremarkable.   MRI showed no acute pathology that could explain her symptoms at that time. Carotid artery duplex was unremarkable bilaterally.  The patient was compliant with her aspirin 81 mg and Lipitor 40 mg. The aphasia lasted for more than a day and was resolved completely after that.  She is still complaining of mild weakness in the right leg which is a residual of the stroke she had in 1995. She uses a cane for ambulation. And she had multiple episodes of falls.  30 day event monitor was also ordered last month, results of which are not available at this point. We faxed the cardiology clinic at White Oak requesting to make the results available for us.     fReview of Systems   Constitutional: Negative. Negative for chills, fever, malaise/fatigue and weight loss.   HENT: Negative. Negative for congestion, ear pain, hearing loss, sinus pain and tinnitus.   Eyes: Negative for blurred vision, double vision, photophobia, pain, discharge and redness.   The patient complained of visual field defects, which showed a residual of the occipital stroke she had in 1995   Respiratory: Negative. Negative for cough, hemoptysis, sputum production, shortness of breath and wheezing.   Cardiovascular: Positive for palpitations. Negative for chest pain and orthopnea.   Gastrointestinal: Positive for heartburn. Negative for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.   Genitourinary: Negative. Negative for dysuria, frequency and urgency.   Musculoskeletal: Negative. Negative for back pain, myalgias and neck pain.   Skin: Negative. Negative for itching and rash.   Neurological: Positive for focal weakness. Negative for dizziness, tingling, tremors, sensory change, speech change, seizures, loss of consciousness and headaches.   Endo/Heme/Allergies: Negative for environmental allergies. Does not bruise/bleed easily.   Psychiatric/Behavioral: Positive for depression. Negative for hallucinations, substance abuse and suicidal ideas.     # TIA     Etiology: still unknown.   Carotid dopplers are normal. We are working up the pt for atrial fibrillation.  The patient had a 30 day event monitor the results of which we couldn't access.  If the results came back normal the next step is to 2 loop recorder to evaluate for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  The patient is already taking aspirin 81 mg and Lipitor 40 mg.  We added Plavix for the regiment for better management of stroke risk and TIAs.  In case we confirmed that the patient has atrial fibrillation, especially that she complains of frequent palpitations, we'll start her on appropriate anticoagulation.        # GERD     Patient uses Pepcid to manage her symptoms.  Since we started the patient on Plavix on top of the aspirin, we switched the Pepcid to Protonix for GI management and better GI prophylaxis against thick ulcers.        # Depression      The patient was on Prozac for depression management.  She says that her symptoms are under control with Prozac. However, whenever she tries to come off of it she experiences relapse of major depression.  Since we started patient on Plavix, there was an interaction between Prozac and Plavix. Apparently, Prozac will decrease the effectiveness of Plavix. To avoid such a complication, we started the patient on Lexapro 5 mg.   The patient is involved in a study at UPMC for depression in the elderly. On switching Prozac to Lexapro we assumed a class effect. In case the researchers at UPMC are concerned about the alternative therapy that we started, they can contact the UPMC McKeesport clinic.   We believe that the benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy and prevention of TIA and stroke, outweighs the risk of increased bleeding. We believe that Lexapro will control the depressive symptoms, and that the stroke prevention is the more persistent issue at this point.

She also reports daily low energy/tiredness and will frequently need to take a short nap after lunch.  She recognizes part of her trouble sleeping may be due to arthritic pain in her hands and back.  Dr. Karp suggested 'If anything, she can increase the dose of Wellbutrin up to 450 mg in the morning to see if it helps decrease sleepiness.  I do think she should stay on the lithium though.'  On 7/27/2018 she had not increased to 450mg Wellbutrin.   Endorsed daily trouble staying asleep and feeling tired/little energy.  This has been reported for quite some time.  She will fall asleep for @ 4-5 hrs and then wake up.  It is hard to fall back asleep because her mind races and she will just doze until it is time to get out of bed.

She says that she read that a way to tell if you are dehydrated is if you pinch your skin and it doesn't bounce back, which she says that her skin does not bounce back and is more saggy under her arms.  She was concerned this could be a side-effect to lithium because her doctor said based on some blood work that she didn't want to go higher on the dose.      Dr. Gebara wrote on 7/27/18:  I don't think dehydration is related to either medication. But lithium is associated with increased frequency and a feeling of thirst which can feel like dehydration. Another thing to check is if she is tachycardic that would be more suggestive that she is dehydrated.   Does she have polyuria? Is she urinating frequently? It depends where you pinch the skin for this test to be reliable. It might be a good idea to let the PCP know as they might want to check BMP, serum and urine osmolality.

This is a 69yo lady with PMHx of COPD, diastolic heart failure.  She had been asked by her doctors to reduce her fluid intake due to bilateral lower extremity edema.  She is augmenting 250mg Zoloft with 150mg Wellbutrin (we had recommended that she increase to 300mg but this was not implemented by her providers at MYCS due to their protocol that they typically meet with the patient prior to making medication changes).  I did reach out to the daughter-in-law today to extend our well wishes.  She is actually relieved that R.WAL is in the hospital to address some of the health issues she has been having.  They may consider transferring her to Presby from McKeesport as her cardiologist is at Presby.

Diagnosis:  Given the history of diarrhea, response to fluid therapy,...the most likely cause (of progressive weakness & hypotension) is dehydration.  The most likely cause of diarrhea is viral gastroenteritis.  She was transferred to ICU for hypotension.  They plan to check for C. difficile & check stool for source of diarrhea.

Her frequency, however, has increased over the past few days. The falls do not seem to be related to the classical syncope or pre-syncope symptoms, except for some dizziness when standing sometimes. She thinks her falls are more likely related to her generalized weakness and 'feeling off'. Neuro exam in non focal. EKG was normal. No signs of structural heart disease. She does have a very significant medication list with many psychiatric meds and also some opioids that could be contributing. High suspicion the etiology of these falls is multifactorial with worsening neuropathy, overmedication, and deconditioning to blame. Will need to rule out orthostatic changes.  -Performed medication reconciliation and patient reports she has been tapering the MS contin - will discontinue this and just continue the oxy for chronic pain  -Check a set of orthostatic vital signs  -TSH is normal.

Initially, was hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 180. However, did improve spontaneously to the 160s. She did receive aspirin and nitroglycerin prior to arrival. She remained chest pain-free while in the emergency department. Her initial troponin is negative.

She has been using Biotene since February but this symptom has become progressively worse and not something she is willing tolerate anymore.  She has recently seen a dentist and it sounds as if the dentist suggested her dry mouth was medication related.  She would be willing to reduce her dose of Effexor or perhaps switch to a med that would be less likely to cause dry mouth.  She did mention that one reason why the dry mouth is so bothersome is that she needs to open her mouth more and then move her jaw side-to-side.  ,Resolved,Thought was that dry mouth was related to Effexor (non-study med) and recommendation was to decrease dose from 300mg to 225mg.      On 10/16/18 she called to report that since starting Wellbutrin 150mg on 10/11/18 dry mouth has worsened to the point that she went to the ER on 10/14/18.  She does have a history of Thrush.  She was told to use warm salt water rinses and was given a prescription on Nystatin.  She stopped taking Wellbutrin on 10/15/18 and is planning to reduce dose of Effexor as well.      On 1/23/2019 at S1C12M she reported continuing bothersome dry mouth.  Her antidepressant has changed from Effexor to Prozac in November 2018.

Of note, we knew about the tremor as he has been reporting this as a side-effect and for which we made adjustments to his Lithium dose and finally told him on 2/12/18 to discontinue taking.  I was to check-in with him on 2/16/18 to see how the tremor was since stopping Lithium.  When I couldn't reach him, which was unusual, I looked in the medical records and saw that he had been admitted.  As there was some reference in the admission reports about Lithium toxicity, Dr. Karp clarified with the inpatient psychiatric resident that this patient's lithium level has always been within therapeutic range, and that the team d/ced it on Monday 2/12/18 because of tremor, but his mental status at all phone calls with the OPTIMUM team have been clear.

He was originally requiring 15L NC in ED, so was admitted to MICU for further care. In MICU, he was covered with unasyn and azithro for RLL, LLL PNA (?aspiration), as well as steroids for COPD exac. He was weaned down to 10L NC,  Despite low Li levels, his tremors persisted. CTH was negative.

Based on this patients' atrial fibrillation onset and course, it is most likely paroxsysmal afib.   Etiology is hard to determine at this time, however hx of OSA may be associated.  Patient's hx of Lithium may also explain why he has slowed ventricular response.'    Medical records also list delirium d/t multiple etiologies as he was having visual hallucinations and confusion.       During our phone call on 2/26/18, he stated that 'the doctors at the hospital feel he should have never been on Lithium in the first place and that was the cause of a lot of his symptoms due to toxicity'.  I did clarify with him that his levels were never above the normal limits.  Regardless he is glad that he discontinued Lithium on 2/12/18.  He continues to take 20mg Celexa.

Patient was evaluated by myself, vital signs are normal. Patient's ordered head CT. Patient was also ordered laboratory testing, CBC, BMP and troponin. Patient's was ordered EKG due to dizziness and 2 falls. Case is discussed with Dr. Wilson.     EKG was completed and shows normal sinus rhythm with PACs. Patient's laboratory testing was completed and reviewed. It is unremarkable for any acute process. Patient negative troponin. Patient had creatinine at her baseline 1.38. Patient's head CT was completed was negative. Patient's laceration will need to be stapled closed. Patient was able to get up and ambulate with mild difficulty. Patient has a walker at home so she'll be using it. Patient wants to be discharged home and I feel that is reasonable plan. Patient was informed of wound care instructions as well as monitoring wound for signs of infection. Patient was advised follow up with PCP. Patient was advised if she continues to have fall she is to return to the emergency room for further evaluation. Patient discharged in stable condition with the husband and son.     Patient is discharged with head injury, fall, scalp laceration.Patient was advised to follow-up with her PCP in the next 3-5 days for reevaluation of symptoms. Patient was advised to return to the emergency room with any new or worsening symptoms. Patient verbalized understanding of instructions and is agreeable to treatment plan. Patient was given a copy of her discharge instructions along with follow-up information. Patient was discharged in stable condition with no further questions.     LACERATION REPAIR:  Patient, procedure, and site were verified immediately before the procedure.  Appropriate neurovascular exam was performed to test sensation, motor function and perfusion.   [The skin around the wound was prepped with Betadine.]  Anesthesia was provided using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine.  Wound was irrigated with a copious amount of [saline].  Wound was explored to its base. [There was no visible foreign body in the wound.]  The laceration was repaired by means of a [single] layer closure. [Skin] was closed with [3 staples]    Total wound length was [2] cm.  [Good hemostasis and cosmetic result.]  Patient tolerated the procedure well.   [Wound was dressed with bacitracin and gauze].                  Impression and Plan   Diagnosis:  Fall  Scalp laceration  Head injury.    Plan:  Discharge.    Discharge Status:  Stable at discharge.                ",Possibly related,No,Yes,Other,No Change to Study Med,"pt will stay at 300mg of wellbutrin, advised to keep hydrated and go slowly from sitting to standing",No,No,,,No,,Complete

At S1C12M on 5/17/19:  She has noticeable essential tremor and she feels propranolol 40mg has not been helpful in controlling her tremor.    On 6/9/2020:  Spoke to her today for ONSS.  She mentioned something that she was interested in your thoughts.  She had premorbid essential tremor that was at first only with intention.  Now tremor is resting, both hands, legs, head, mouth & jaw.  Sees a neurologist who suggested worsening tremor may be related to her antidepressant medications (completed OPTIMUM in May 2019 on 40mg Prozac & 450mg Wellbutrin), at that time was very off balance with frequent falls, found to be B12 deficient, received injects, balance or falls are no longer an issue).  Per neurologists encouragement she tapered and stopped both Prozac and Wellbutrin about 3 months ago.  She reports her mood is stable, tremor has improved somewhat.  She was taking for essential tremor both propranolol and primidone but also discontinued those.  I recommended making appointment with neurologist to ask about restarting medications for tremor.  She mentioned that neurologist is considering Parkinson's among the differential.    Her question is should she need to restart an antidepressant, is there one you could suggest that would be least likely to contribute to tremor?

No contraindication.  j    From: 'Kincman, Joelle (Scanlon)' <scanjm2@UPMC.EDU>  Date: Thursday, March 29, 2018 at 4:18 PM  I received a call from UP10087 on 3/29/18 (her Wk 6 call is scheduled for tomorrow).  She is taking 60mg Cymbalta & 300mg Wellbutrin.  She wanted us to know that she saw her ENT on 3/22/18 for low-pitched tinnitus (bilateral) which is associated with reduced hearing and some pressure in the ears.  She also reported to them some episodes of mild dizziness yesterday and today.  She was prescribed high dose prednisone taper (60mg x9d, 50 x1d, 40 x1d, 30 x1d, 20 x1d, 10 x1d).  Apparently this has resulted in elevated blood glucose (she does have DM Type I).  She read that prednisone and Wellbutrin could have possible interactions and wanted to let us be aware of this med change.    1)	This is not the first person on Wellbutrin who has reported some type of 'ringing, humming' in their ears.  Is tinnitus related to Wellbutrin?  If not AE will be reported as not related, mild, unexpected.  It is not a 'listed' side-effect and she did not report it as a side-effect.    2)	Is there a contraindication of Wellbutrin and Prednisone?  ",Ongoing,"4/16/18:  JMK changed severity from mild to moderate.  She does have some bilateral hearing loss associated with the tinnitus (ambient noise/humming) in both ears.  She reported at the Week 8 call on 4/13/18 that she followed-up again with ENT and they gave her steroid injections in both ears and are recommending another course of high dose prednisone taper.  At WK 10 on 4/25/18 she reported that last Thursday (4/19/18) she saw the ENT again and received another steroid injection in both ears.  She feels that the background noise 'roar' has lessened and her hearing is starting to improve.  She continues on 40mg prednisone daily.      ONGOING AT STUDY COMPLETION:  S1C12M completed in person on 4/23/19.  She entered continuation as a remitter.  Compliant with augmenting 60mg Cymbalta qam with 300mg Wellbutrin qam.   Denies side-effects, falls, or alcohol use.  Hearing has been worsening and creating problems at home.  She is at the point where she feels hearing aids would be helpful but they are expensive and not covered by insurance.  She has Meniere's disease and tinnitus.

She will continue hemodialysis 3 days/week for the kidney inury, outpatient Hepatitis C treatment for the liver problems, and plan to follow-up at a walk-in clinic for hopefully inpatient rehab for opioid use disorder.    I spoke with patient briefly attempting to schedule Step 2 Continuation 12 month on 8/9/19, which patient declined, noting she intended to go to rehab on Monday, 8/13/19, and that her friend was with her. On 8/12/19, she had a relapse of heroin use along with crack cocaine. Use continued to the next morning, when she was found unresponsive by her friend, who administered narcan. Patient was transported to the ER and admitted for the overdose and treatment of sequelae including kidney injury and liver imbalance. It is unclear at this time if this was a suicide attempt. ER suspected possible tylenol OD as well due to liver imbalances, but acetaminophen/tylenol levels came back negative. Patient is noted as having been abusing alcohol for some time (1 bottle of wine per day). Hospitalization is ongoing as of 8/16/19.",Resolved,"Patient has history of alcohol and IV drug abuse, which was noted as in remission during Acute study participation, but alcohol use was increasing and near full relapse at Step 2 continuation 8 month. We provided the following PCP update at that visit:  She reports her alcohol use has increased since we last spoke though, which may explain why the dose increase at last visit has not provided benefit to her. She reports drinking about 3 glasses of wine per day to cope with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Twenty-one drinks per week is in the moderate-high risk category, especially considering this patient's history of drug abuse. I educated the patient on the effects of alcohol on depression, including that since it is a depressant it can directly worsen symptoms and that it may interfere with treatment response to antidepressants like Lexapro. I encouraged her strongly to reduce her use. She said she'd 'taken to heart' this advice and would be willing to cut back.     Dr. Gebara and I have communicated the following plan to the patient to address her alcohol use and depression:  1) Continue or re-establish NA meeting attendance  2) Reduce current alcohol use to 7 drinks per week or less  3) We've provided referral to a therapist who specializes in depression and alcohol/drug abuse in seniors, Taffie Bucci 412-453-3127, who can provide assistance and support in this effort.  4) We will plan to check in with her in 2-4 weeks by phone, and if she has cut back her alcohol use and still remains depressed, we will recommend augmenting her Lexapro with aripiprazole 2 mg at that time.  I followed up with the patient the following day (5/2/19) to provide these instructions. I was unable to reach the patient for the planned extra visit (she has been chronically difficult to reach/schedule since entry in continuation).    Inpatient evaluation:  Basic Information   Visit Information:  Patient seen on 8/13/2019.       Chief Complaint   Heroin Overdose      History of Present Illness   61yo female w/ Hx of reactive arthritis, HCV, alcohol abuse, and polysubstance abuse (heroin and crack) who presented to the ED following heroin overdose and loss of consciousness. Patient reported that she snorted a bag of heroin last night and went to sleep feeling completely at baseline. She woke up today and her roommate brought her another bag of heroin, which they both injected at 10am. She was then reportedly found unresponsive by her friend, in the afternoon, who administered her Narcan and called EMS. She recalls EMS arriving and reports refusing initially to report to the ED but was eventually amendable to the transport. She reports a similar previous episode where she overdosed on heroin back in june 2017 and was taken to Forbes Hospital, where she reports remained for several days under observation. Patient reports that she does not follow up regularly with her PCP and has not received treatment for HCV. She states that her HCV has resolved spontaneously. She reports no CP, SOB, abdominal pain, skin discolorations, tremors, headaches, lightheadedness, fever, wt loss, dysuria, diarrhea, hemoptysis or hematemsis. She does endorse n/v which she reports started after she was administered Narcan.      Of note, patient reports a hx of a mechanical fall 2 weeks ago where she tripped on her cat after snorting heroin. She reports that she fell, hit her head and hurt her neck as well. Since then she has experienced head and neck pain which have persisted and worsened today. She denies any weakness, numbness, tingling, urinary or fecal incontinence.      On arrival to the ED, patient's vitals were remarkable for temp 37.1, HR 74, BP 105/71 and saturating 97% on RA. Initial work up was remarkable for transaminitis w/ ALT >5000 and AST> 10000, hyperkalemia (K 5.2), elevated Creatinine (2.1), lactic acidosis (lactate 2.3) and AG metabolic acidosis (AG 15.4). BP continued to decrease to 80s/50s. EKG was remarkable for sinus bradycardia and left axis deviation. Pt had 1 blood streaked stool. Rectal exam showed several external hemorrhoids. No gross blood but she was hemoccult + which i suspect is related to hemorrhoids. Patient was given 2L crystalloids and administered N-acetylcysteine for possible acetaminophen toxicity. Toxicology screening labs including tylenol, salicylate, ethanol, and CPK as well as CT abdomen and pelvis were ordered and patient was admitted to medicine for further workup.

This matter is now considered to be closed.    UP10132 called me today to tell me that she was experiencing shivering, body aches, and a racing heartbeat, as well as feeling hot (she was unaware if she had a temperature). She is taking wellbutrin 450mg and effexor 75mg (started 6 days ago), and said she believed the Effexor contributed to these symptoms, and because she seemed to be in fairly acute distress, I recommended that she be seen at the Emergency Department. She presented to the ED on 6/25 and was admitted with a working diagnosis of acute kidney injury, bradycardia and hypotension, and a 1st degree AV heart block was found on EKG. It is unknown whether the antidepressants she was taking contributed to her symptoms, and we are pursuing consultation from the pharmacy. The hospital team has advised her to discontinue the Effexor.    On 6/26/19 this participant died while in-patient due to cardiac arrest secondary to acute myocardial infarction.    Per consultation with a geriatric clinical pharmacist, the following information from literature and case review was provided.  There is a chance that venlafaxine may be associated with the patient's hypotension, but it's not very likely.  Patients in a previous study did not experience bradycardia nor did they experience a concomitant AKI.  In both the literature and case reports, the symptoms of increased venlafaxine exposure do not mimic the symptoms described by UP10132 who presented to the hospital with AKI, bradycardia, and hypotension.  Overall, although there is a chance that UP10132 could have experienced a paradoxical episode of hypotension secondary to venlafaxine, it's difficult to attribute the patient's complete presentation to her antidepressant therapy.

Patient and family discussions: Yes.       Hospital Course      Patient is 86 y/o F with PMH significant for grade II diastolic HF (as per previous TTE in 05/2019), atrial fibrilation (not on AC), CVA/TIA w/o residual weakness, COPD, MD and hypothyroidism who presented on 7/1 with complains of SOB, fatigue, generalized weakness and DOE for several weeks. On initial evaluation in ED, patient was hemodynamically stable with normal HR. Physical exam was remarkable for JVD+ and bibasilar wheezing and crackles. She received DuoNebs, Methylprednisolone as well as Lasix IV. Patient was admitted to medicine service under the impression of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to acute diastolic HF exacerbation with possible component of mild COPD exacerbation/viral bronchitis. Upon admission, patient developed rapid Afib requiring treatment with Diltiazem IV gtt. Patient was monitored on telemetry and continued on IV diuresis with Lasix. As per cardiology recommendations, since her CHADS2VASC score is 6, patient was started on AC with Apixaban BID. Once the HR was optimized, patient was transitioned to PO Diltiazem that resulted in appropriate HR control. Repeated TTE showed grade III diastolic dysfunction. After optimizing patient's volume status, Lasix was switched from IV to PO. As per cardiology recommendations, her HF regimen was optimized by adding Spironolactone 12.5mg PO daily. Her statin medication was changed from Simvastatin to Pravastatin to avoid potential interactions with Cardizem. Patient also received 5 days course of PO Prednisone for possible mild COPD exacerbation. Her TSH level was checked and showed level of <0.01. Levothyroxine dose was decreased from 200 to 175mcg but patient refused to take the lower dose stating that she has been stable on the current dose for many years. All the risks were explained to patient and she verbalized understanding. Of note, patient has a long history refusing to take lower dose of Levothyroxine which is also documented in her PCP's notes (Dr.Fiorillo) who spoke to patient regarding this issue during this hospital stay as well (7/8/2019). During this hospital stay her depression was managed with home dose of Citalopram and she did not express and active suicidal or homicidal ideations.      Today, patient reports feeling well and she has no active complains. Denies CP, SOB, cough, palpitations or LE edema. Hemodynamically stable and euvolemic on physical exam. Patient is ready to be discharged home today with HHA, visit nursing services, home PT and tele-health services. She will follow up with her PCP next week and cardiology in 4 weeks.

Daughter had multiple concerns about her mother coming home as she states the pt has difficulty with her ADLs and IADLs. The daughter states the pt typically does not get oob till 2pm and does not eat much or drink much during the day. Daughter states the pt's health has significantly decreased and she fears that she will lose her mother if somethgin does not change. Her mother lives home alone  and daughter feels she can not fully take care of herself and at times she will frequently fall at home. I told the daughter I will discuss everything with the case manager, and also suggested that the daughter call the unit and talk with the case manager.

She reports vivid dreams since starting NTP which wake her up at night and are disturbing even during the day because she will see something and it will remind her of the dream and makes her question if the dream really happened or not.  Not necessarily nightmares but startling.      In consideration of this we recommend that increasing NTP from 75mg to 100mg for her to do 50mg BID to help with this symptom.

Workup was unremarkable except for mild filling defect in the subsegmental arteries of the left lower lobe. Her EKG she was unremarkable and her troponins were negative. Her exercise oximetry showed no O2 requirement. The patient had recently stopped Ranexa. When this was restarted, the patient had no further chest pain. She was seen by the pulmonary team who did not feel that she needed any anticoagulation or any further pulmonary workup. Because her symptoms had improved, we felt that she was stable for discharge.

Got checked out and no heart attack, nothing much to be done. They reduced carvedilol to address some hypotension/bradycardia and the chest pain resolved. She was discharged 2/24/2020. Cardiology consult and discharge summary below.    IMPRESSION:  1.  Atypical chest discomfort that occurred in the right shoulder, then in the left shoulder and then in the right upper quadrant.  I am not 100% convinced this is ischemic.  Her troponins are negative.  2.  Diffuse atherosclerosis based on previous heart catheterization.  3.  Multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, combined hyperlipidemia, obesity, untreated sleep apnea and a very strong family history and remote smoking.     PLAN:  This is a tough case.  I do not have a lot of options here.  I think the best thing we did was optimize medical therapy without anything objective on an EKG or troponins, I am reluctant to repeat a heart catheterization.  The best thing to do right now is to ambulate this lady put her back on her Ranexa, her nitrates and she is on carvedilol, I see at 25 mg twice a day.  I am looking at her office chart and it appears that all of her medicines have been restarted.  There is a history of noncompliance.  I wonder if she was noncompliant.  The other thing that we can do for this lady is possibly add Plavix instead of aspirin.  I think it is a more effective antiplatelet or we can get both aspirin and Plavix.  I think the best thing right here is to  just ambulate her and if she is stable, discharge her later today or tomorrow morning.  I just do not think testing is going to change anything I do.

He does have postural changes and associated dizziness.  Adjustment of his blood pressure medications may help with symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  He has not had any recent falls.    Dr. Karp's response to his PCP:  Dr. Gongloff -- given his orthostasis, persistent htn, and unsteadiness (and relatively recent fall), do you think that the metoprolol is interfering with compensatory increase in HR to prevent orthostasis?

The MRI of the brain showed changes consistent with SVID and the cervical spine showed degenerative changes without evidence of myelopathic changes.

Finally was re-referred to OPTIMUM after a visit with his PCP on 1/14/2020 and met with myself and Jordan on 1/22/2020 with his wife and son.        Diagnosis is major depression with psychotic features.  Symptoms are low mood, anhedonia, spending about 18 hours/day in bed, excessive worry, and fixed ideas that he has a terminal illness, either cancer or AIDS.  Despite several attempts to reassure him he does not have these diseases, he continued to perseverate that he very well may.  He is becoming deconditioned by this excessive amount of time in bed, per his family.  He is anxious if his wife is not around.  He is not suicidal.   Given the severity of his symptoms and how disabled he is by these symptoms, Jordan recommended inpatient admission on the geriatric unit at WPIC.  To help with this process, we obtained CBC, BMP, TSH, and EKG at our office to avoid an ER admission and do a direct voluntary admission.  After he had labs and EKG, they returned home as there were no acute safety concerns and to await bed availability.  A bed was available and he was admitted on 1/22/2020 for further psychiatric treatment.  Treatment plan is to augment with a low dose of Olanzapine and initiate cross taper of his current antidepressant, 40mg Celexa, to Sertraline.  During participation he had been randomized to switch to Wellbutrin but could not tolerate switch and continued on index med of Celexa.

He does not feel these symptoms are associated with Wellbutrin or Remeron as he said he has had these symptoms on & off for a while now.  He said his dizziness is mostly with positional changes.

I did see J.BOW yesterday.  He was seen in the ED for his back pain prior to our visit and received a steroid dose pack as well as ibuprofen 600 tid for 10 days.  He did say that his mood has been more low especially in the past wk with the back pain.  He also mentioned some reminders of his military service which triggered some negative ruminative thoughts.  He got a lithium level after our visit which was < 0.1 at 3:17 pm.  I'm concerned about increasing the lithium level further though especially since he just got the ibuprofen from the ED.

He said that things have gotten worse to the point he may try to go to the ER in the morning.      Commenting about severe back pain, feeling overall not well, and cannot sleep.  He denied fever, chest pains, or falls.  He has not checked blood sugar or blood pressure today.  I encouraged that he do so.  I asked if he had someone to take him to ER but wife is asleep and he said he cannot go now because he needs to pick up his granddaughter from school.  I encouraged him to go to the ER if needed and keep up posted.  I suggested he should have them do Lithium level just to check.      He usually does not contact me to complain so this was concerning.     As a reminder he is taking 450mg Wellbutrin qam & 300mg Lithium qhs.   We do not believe his complaints sound medication related.   He has been feeling worse overall for the past several weeks.   We will check in with him later this week as a follow-up.

I'm copying Eric's response about it below:    I'd call it unlikely related, since the hypokalemia resolved while the patient was still on aripiprazole (it resolved 24hr after his last dose -- given ari's long half-life, it's still totally in his system 24hr later).      I would agree with unexpected, given the nature of the AE.    I did report it to the WU IRB, but they indicated it did not meet reporting guidelines because we reported it was probably not related to the research. Is there any more information available from the Pitt IRB?  Thanks,  Emily     Patient called on 6/18/19 in after 11 days on aripiprazole 2 mg augmenting duloxetine 90 mg. Her daughter had noticed some slowed/slurred speech and concentration difficulties. The speech changes were pronounced and noticeable by her study clinician, who completed her Week 2 evaluation, then contacted the site PI immediately. The patient was instructed to discontinue the aripiprazole and, considering her history of subdural hematoma/craniotomy evacuation, we suggested an ER evaluation. She presented to the ER at UPMC Passavant on 6/18/19 and was admitted for the night for evaluation. An EEG was performed showing isolated right hemispheric sharps but no suggestion of seizure activity. Patient labs were notable for hypokalemia, which was corrected. The speech changes appeared to have resolved the following day, notably after aripiprazole was stopped. The patient was discharged on 6/19/19.

Recurrence of subdural hematoma noted on March 22, 2018 with symptoms of lethargy and language changes. S/p surgical intervention. Other medical history includes hyperlipidemia, anxiety, depression. She presents as a new consultation for intermittent slurred speech.      She was started on Abilify two days ago.  Shortly after she noticed cognitive changes in word finding difficulties. Family noticed language changes yesterday which prompted ER evaluation. Her Abilify was discontinued and she noticed improvement to her cognitive complaints. No speech difficulties at this time. She mentions paresthesia to her lower extremities, but no focal complaints. She denies motor weakness. She has gait instability, but no falls. She was on Keppra briefly for seizure precautions, however this was discontinued. No aspirin, Plavix or other blood thinning medications at this time.      Histories      Past Medical History   Right-sided subdural hematoma with recurrence in March 2018, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, depression.     Impression and Recommendations   This is a 71-year-old female seen as a new consultation for language changes noted by family. She was started on Abilify and shortly after noted cognitive side effects. Family noted language changes yesterday which prompted ER evaluation. Abilify was discontinued with improvement to cognitive complaints.  Language appears normal on exam.  CT head completed and negative for acute findings. MRI brain completed and negative for acute findings. Symptoms most likely explained by medication, however seizure should be included in differential (history of SDH).  Plan for EEG.  No ptosis or other findings of myasthenia gravis  on exam.  We'll follow for testing results.  Dr. Massa evaluation to follow.        Diagnosis:  History of SHD, language changes. .

Addendum by MASSA MD, ROBYN E on June 19, 2019 2:59 PM:      I have seen and examined the patient and agree with plan of care in the CRNP note. Patient states her daughter told her that her speech has been slurred the last few days. The patient herself has not noticed any speech changes and she feels well. She has no complaints. She had a R SDH evacuated last year and has done well since then. No seizures.     Neurological exam is normal. She is awake, alert, appropriate. No dysarthria or aphasia. Mental status, CNs, motor, sensory, DTRs, cerebellar exam normal.     MRI brain: there are extensive WM changes but no new acute change.  UA positive, she is asymptomatic  EEG: isolated right hemispheric sharps     71 yo F with history R SDH s/p evacuation with reported dysarthria that resolved with stopping abilify. Exam at this time is normal. EEG does show isolated right hemispheric sharps likely due to cortical irritability from prior SDH, however history is not suggestive of seizure.   -Recommend follow-up in neurology clinic. Would obtain 48  hour ambulatory EEG for any recurrent neurologic symptoms that may be concerning for seizure    EEG 6/19/19  UPMCPassavant  Pulmonary  EEG Report    ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  MARK A WOODBURN  ADMISSION DATE:  06/18/2019  EVALUATION DATE:  06/19/2019     This is a 22-channel digital EEG obtained during alert state.  The tracing  was performed for 25 minutes and 8 seconds in duration.     Low voltage 8 cps alpha activity is seen in the background of the tracing  with left hemispheric accentuation.  Slower 7 cps theta activity with  occasional sharp wave appearance is seen involving right hemisphere with  some accentuation of right frontal and right temporal region.   Hyperventilation was not attempted in this case.  Photic stimulation did  not evoke a photo convulsive response.  The patient remained alert  throughout the tracing.     IMPRESSION:      This EEG obtained during the alert state is abnormal.  There is asymmetric  mild slowing involving right hemisphere compared to left with isolated  sharp forms present involving right temporal and parietal region.  These  areas are suggestive of epileptiform character, but are isolated in  character.  Background eye blink, muscle and movement artifact is present.        ______________________________  Electronically authenticated at end of document.      Dictated by: David M.

A single EKG channel was used throughout the recording. Video was reviewed if available.       Background:  There is a well-developed, symmetric, rhythmical 8-9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm that attenuates with eye opening. The background is continuous, spontaneously variable and appropriately reactive.  Very subtle asymmetry was seen between the hemispheres with the high amplitude of the discharges over the right parietal head region due to the previously performed craniotomy, representing a breach rhythm  Activation: The patient was alert, oriented and appropriately followed commands and answered questions. Photic stimulation did not elicit any abnormal activation.   Sleep: Patient became drowsy, fell asleep, sleep patterns were seen, sleep was interruptive, vertex waves, spindles were evident     Epileptiform discharges: none  Seizures: none     Additional Channels: The EKG channel was unremarkable.       Test Interpretation   This along EEG monitoring has failed to record the presence of definite epileptiform discharges, seizures or other focal abnormalities   Very subtle asymmetry could response to the location of previously performed craniotomy with a high amplitude of the discharges over the right parietal head region  Otherwise, clinical correlation is needed      Professional Services   Credentials Title and Author     Credentials: MD.

A single EKG channel was used throughout the recording. Video was reviewed if available.    Slow BG activity was seen over the left hemisphere, in the Delta range.   High amplitude Delta was evident over the left frontal-temporal region, with the presence of the high amplitude sharp waves, with frequency of 1 -2/second.  At the same time, suppression was seen over the right hemisphere, with the presence of the slowing in the delta range  Occasionally, sharp waves were seen over the right frontal-central to right temporal regions     HV could not be performed  Photic did not elicit a well developed driving response     Despite the presence of the sharp waves, this EEG has failed to reveal the presence of the electrographic seizure   Additional Channels: The EKG channel was unremarkable.       Test Interpretation   This an abnormal study for the patient of this age due to the presence of the epileptiform discharges, evident over the both cerebral hemispheres, but much more pronounced over the Left frontal- temporal area.

Sterile drape, gown and mask were used as personal   protection. 1% lidocaine was in the left groin subcutaneously for   local anesthesia.     A 21-gauge needle was used for access the left common femoral artery   under ultrasound guidance. A 0.018 guidewire was placed coaxially   through the needle. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture   sheath. A Bentson wire was advanced to the abdominal aorta through   the micropuncture sheath. The micropuncture sheath was exchanged for   a short 5 French vascular sheath over the wire.      A 5 French Omni Flush catheter was advanced over the Bentson wire.   The wire and catheter was brought up and over the aortic bifurcation   and advanced into the right internal iliac artery. A subtraction   angiogram was obtained. A renegade high flow microcatheter and fathom   microwire were advanced coaxially through the base catheter and into   a small branch of the internal iliac artery. Gelfoam embolization was   performed.     The microwire and catheter were then removed.     The 0.035 wire and catheter was then retracted and directed into the   right external iliac artery. A subtraction angiogram was obtained at   this location. The renegade microcatheter and fathom microwire were   then coaxially advanced through the base catheter and into the   inferior epigastric artery. Embolization was performed with 0.2 cc of   Trufill glue. The microcatheter and wire were then removed. A final   subtraction angiogram was obtained through the base catheter.     The wires, catheters, and vascular sheath were then removed.   Hemostasis of the left common femoral artery was obtained with an   Angio-Seal vascular closure device deployed in the usual fashion.     There are no immediate post procedure complications. The patient will   return to the emergency department in stable condition.     Findings:  Small irregular artery originating from the right internal iliac   artery. Gelfoam embolization of the artery demonstrate no evidence of   post embolization filling of contrast.     Active extravasation originating from the right inferior epigastric   artery. Interval glue embolization of the right inferior epigastric   artery. Post embolization angiogram demonstrated absence of contrast   filling the inferior epigastric artery.     IMPRESSION  Impression:  Small irregular vessel originating from the right internal iliac   artery, Gelfoam embolization was performed.  Glue embolization of active extravasation originating from the right   inferior epigastric artery.

Discharge diagnosis was hypertensive emergency and flash pulmonary edema. Medications were adjusted and a more strict diet was prescribed. She improved once they got her BP under control and was discharged in stable condition on 3/17/2020. Cardiology evaluation and discharge summary below.      Inpatient consult 3/13/2020       History of Present Illness?     Patient is a 72-year-old white female with past medical history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, CVA, provoked DVT/PE, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and mood disorder who was initially admitted due to hypertensive emergency. ?Patient statesthat over the past 2 or 3 weeks she has been progressively more short of breath which acutely worsened over the past few days. ?She previously been attributing her shortness of breath to increased stress from the passing of her mother, and thought that shewas having panic attacks. ?She reports that while she never had any chest pain she did have some pain across her shoulders which worsened when attempting to take a deep breath. ?Over the last few days she is also developed a nonproductive cough but no fevers,no personal travel outside of the area, and no sick contacts that she is aware of; she does note that her occupational therapist recently returned from a cruise and she did see her therapist 1 week ago but was already short of breath at that point. ?She hasbeen able to continue walking around her home and had been taking care of her mother up until her mother's passing, but did so with increasing difficulty. ?She recalls at least 3 episodes of PND over the past 3 weeks and at baseline has a 2 pillow orthopneabut more recently has been sleeping in a recliner. ?She does have chronic right lower extremity edema greater than left which she does not note has changed recently. ?She eventually decided to call EMS due to progressively worsening dyspnea. ?On arrival patientwas noted to have a systolic blood pressure of 220 and was given aspirin 325 mg, 3 sublingual nitro times, Nitropaste by EMS. ?She was also hypoxic to 85 percent. ?She continued to be hypertensive and tachycardic on arrival to the ED and she was subsequently placedon BiPAP received 40 mg IV Lasix, 1.25 mg IV enalapril, and placed on a nitro drip. ?Her systolic blood pressure decreased from 1 80-80 therefore the drip was turned off. ?She continued at that time to have decreased mentation therefore she has been pain onBiPAP and then admitted to the ICU. ?She however at this point states that she is feeling much better than she had over the past several weeks, back to her baseline mentation, and has had improved respirations.              Impression and Recommendations?      Diagnosis: ?Hypertensive emergency (ICD10-CM I16.1, Working, Diagnosis), Flash pulmonary edema (ICD10-CM J81.0, Working, Diagnosis). ?          Patient is a 72-year-old white female with past medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, CVA, provoked DVT/PE, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and mood disorder who was initially admitted due to hypertensive emergency,with progressive SOB over the last several weeks. Cardiology is now consulted for HTN emergency and concern for new LBBB.         HTN Emergency     - Patient's home regimen is losartan 50 mg daily and carvedilol 6.25 mg daily; she states that she has been compliant with her medications despite the increased stress from taking care of her mother and her mother's passing, missingat most 1-2 doses of her medications a week; she also reports a relatively high salt diet but states that she has been doing this for some 5 years    - Unclear etiology for what tipped her over into hypertensive emergency on this particular occasion, however her blood pressures were aggressively reduced with multiple medications and she is currently normotensive    - Agree with continuing carvedilol 6.25 at this time, however she can certainly have this increased as tolerated    - Can add back her losartan 50 mg if blood pressures begin to increase again    - Agree with PRN IV labetalol 10 mg every 4 hours; she may eventually need the addition of a diuretic as well to her home regimen in order to maintain good blood pressures at home    - Would give additional dose of 40 mg IV Lasix today given that she still has crackles and decreased lung sounds    - Continue to monitor blood pressures closely         N STEMI, left bundle branch block     -Troponin initially negative with slight increase to 0.15, likely secondary demand ischemia given her hypertension tachycardia    - Left bundle branch block seen on her EKG is not new; she did have a stress test in October 2019 where a left bundle was appreciated at a heart rate of 100, and she is also had a cardiac cath in 2014 that showed mild disease in theLAD and the RCA    - Agree with obtaining repeat echo at this time; her last echo in July 2019 had an EF of 40 percent, grade 1 diastolic dysfunction, moderately dilated LV and, and mild diffuse hypokinesis    - At this time she does not require any further work-up for this left bundle branch block which is likely indicative of underlying conduction abnormalities given her cardiomyopathy and is rate related         Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. ?We will follow along with you. ?Please contact the cardiology service with any questions or concerns.

On December 8, we circulated a document to the DSMB with our initial attribution of the SAE to study participation as 'not related.'  Upon further deliberation, we think it is more precise to change the attribution of this SAE as 'possibly related.'   Our rationale for changing the possible attribution is in response to the FDA 2011 MedWatch Advisory Safety Communication describing abnormal heart rhythms associated with higher doses of Celexa (citalopram hydrobromide).  This participant had been taking citalopram 40 mg since 2010, but he had not had a repeat EKG (as far as we know) for the past 5 years.  While he had a number of other medical comorbidities, social determinants of poor health (including poverty interfering with ability to pay for antihypertensive medications at times), given his exposure to citalopram 40 mg, we cannot definitively conclude that his death was not a cardiac event that was possibly related to exposure to this medication.  This change in SAE attribution does not change the risk/benefit analysis of participation in the study.   We will, however, continue to be vigilant during the continuation phase for participants who may be prescribed citalopram at doses higher than 20 mg/day, and recommend they discuss with their PCP if they should have a repeat EKG, lower the dose, or switch medications, to promote ongoing participant safety.  Sincerely,  Jordan F. Karp, MD  Pittsburgh Site PI    SAE Reported to the PITT IRB on 12/14/2020 as possibly related.    12/7/2020:  Participant J.FOR is deceased.  I was trying to reach him for his S1C12M assessment and his phone number was not in service.  I looked in the medical records and found this dated 8/14/2020.  Not related, unexpected.      61yo, white male, non-hispanic  past medical history of depression, hypertension, TIA  Consented 9/11/19 at age 60  Randomized 9/17/19 to augment with Wellbutrin  Started Wellbutrin 9/21/19.  Was taking 40mg Celexa & 150mg Wellbutrin as of S1C8month call on 8/3/2020.  Our recommendation was to increase to 300mg Wellbutrin was sent to PCP on 8/10/2020 & approved by PCP on 8/10/2020.    Was also participating in Optimum Neuro and ONSS.      Only other medication was lisinopriL-hydrochlorothiazide (PRINZIDE) 20-25 mg oral tablet    Medical Comorbidities   Valgus deformity of foot  Obesity, unspecified  Essential hypertension  Tobacco use disorder  Generalized anxiety disorder  Irritable bowel syndrome  Unspecified transient cerebral ischemia    Per medical records on 8/14/2020:  The patient had not been to work for a few days, so they were called to go check on him. When they arrived at his house, they unfortunately found him deceased. He was resting in his bed and appeared to have passed away in his sleep. The police stated they to not think this was foul play, and do not suspect anything other than natural causes.    Last contact with OPTIMUM was S1C8M on 8/3/2020.      This was the update from that time point     He is compliant with augmenting 40mg Celexa (2 tablets of 20mg daily) with 150mg Wellbutrin XL qam.  He denies side-effects, health complaints, or falls.  He reports social alcohol use mainly on weekends.  Previously he had some difficulties with obtaining his medications but changing insurance and pharmacy has made his medications more affordable and compliance is no longer an issue.     His depression score on the PHQ-9 = 8.  Daily low interest, frequent trouble falling asleep, occasional low mood, hopelessness, feeling tired, poor appetite.  The current uncertainty of the health crisis makes him contemplate how much longer he will be here, but he wants to value the time he has.  Sometimes feels weary of life and despair from being alone & struggling but denies wishes, thoughts or plans of accelerating death.  Attributes anxiety and difficulty falling asleep from stress/worrying about what's going on and having trouble shutting off his mind.  Still having some interpersonal conflict at work but it doesn't get to him like it used to.  Lately his spirits were lifted by being able to watch baseball again and speak to his kids.        To help with continued anhedonia and anxiety, Dr. Karp recommends increasing Wellbutrin to 300mg daily and continuing 40mg Celexa daily.   James is aware of this recommendation and is willing to increase dose of Wellbutrin, his only hesitation was he would like to make sure this does not change the costs of his medications.  For your convenience, an order for 300mg Wellbutrin XL qam has been pended for your review and approval if you agree with this recommendation.

At week 10 she had had a few high anxiety/panicky days but was otherwise feeling good (PHQ-9 = 6) and wanted to put off decision for STEP 2.  Today, she is augmenting 40mg Prozac with 450mg Wellbutrin.  Continues to have dry mouth.  Also reporting some blurry vision (particularly with reading) that started @ a week ago (prescription bifocals are only about 6 month old).  She was wondering if blurry vision could be related to either Prozac or Wellbutrin.  In case it is related to dry eyes she will try some moistening drops.  One partial fall, tripped up the stairs, caught herself with her arm (sustained a bruise), did not seek medical attention.  No alcohol.  Did need to resort to using her medical marijuana a couple times over the past two weeks to help with anxiety.    PHQ-9 = 7.  Feels her mood is steady but still has some trouble with anxiety leaving the house.  Mainly only goes out to pick up her groceries which she orders online and to see her therapist.  She has bloodwork that she has been putting off and intends to complete it tomorrow.  Discussed barriers & plans.  Main complaint is anxiety which then makes her feel bad about herself.  Her anxiety drains her and then she feels down & fatigued.  She reports this has happened a couple times over the past two weeks.  We discussed STEP 2 and options.  She would like to speak with her therapist (appointment is on the 29th) and PCP @ STEP 2 and asked if we could speak again in 2 weeks before deciding to move forward.  Any other recommendations if she does not wish to enter STEP 2?   Dr. Gebara responded:  she could try artificial tears and see if it helps with her eyes. She could try increasing her Prozac to 60 mg if she does not wish to go to step 2. With a PHQ of 7, that may be a good idea for her. It's good she has a therapist to help with her anxiety as well.     Although she did not mention this specific symptom at S1C4M, there is no indication it had resolved.  She was lost to follow-up for S1C8M & S1C12M so there has been no additional contact with her.  However, in a note from her PCP on 11/5/2020 the patient wishes to wean-off Wellbutrin.

She is experiencing blurry vision and now it hurts.  She has been using drops and does not consider this to be dry eyes.  She thinks it is associated with increasing Wellbutrin to 450mg.  Before I call her back (most likely plan would be to go back to 300mg and see if that helps), I wanted to see if to your knowledge blurry or painful vision could be related to Wellbutrin (not to my knowledge or to our list of side-effects).

Blurry and painful vision makes me concerned about glaucoma.  However, I reviewed her chart, and I don't see anything about glaucoma.  She does not use eye drops.  I suggest she stop the Wellbutrin, none tomorrow, and restart 300 mg on Saturday.  She should also call her PCP and inform them about the blurriness and pain.  Her PCP may have ideas about this.  Thanks,  Jordan    From  JMK:  Okay.  Thank you.  She still feels that it could be related ('I am the type of person that if you are going to get a weird reaction to a med, it is me').    She is on board with the plan to not take any Wellbutrin tomorrow and then go back to 300mg Wellbutrin on Saturday.    She is going to see her eye doctor next week.   Vision has changed that it is hard to see out of her new glasses (@ 6M old)  The drops she has been using are called Sustain (OTC).  She also mentioned increased constipation for which she is using Miralax.    I will check in with her next week to see how she is feeling.    I will update her PCP to let her know we are suggesting to go back to 300mg.

She was diagnosed with Duodenitis. Unexpected, not related.    73-year-old female who presented for evaluation of bilateral leg pain and abdominal pain. Patient endorsed worsening crampy constant abdominal pain over the past several days to presentation in addition to similar pain beneath her left breast. She said that eating seemed to upset her stomach more and worsen the pain. She had a lot of nausea, but did not vomit. She tried taking laxatives for that maybe she was constipated, but this did not help. She has ongoing neuropathy in her legs, which she follows with a pain doctor for and has had her dose of Neurontin adjusted as is an outpatient. Admission, VSS. Labs relatively unremarkable. Troponin negative ×3. D-dimer elevated. CTA chest without PE, no acute findings. CTAP showed duodenitis. Patient was admitted to the hospitalist service for further evaluation and management.         Duodenitis: Patient was maintained with supportive care including IVF hydration and pain control as necessary. Her PPI was increased to twice daily. She did have improvement of her pain. Recommend that she continue to use the PPI twice daily on discharge and follow-up with her GI as an outpatient if needed.         Neuropathy: Patient was continued on her home dose of gabapentin. We did add in a low dose of Flexeril to try to help with her pain and discomfort while here, but unfortunately the medication's sedative effects made it unsafe for discharge as the patient lives alone. Chronic pain was consulted and recommended titrating her gabapentin back to 300mg TID and continuing the oxycodone 15mg q8 prn. She should continue to follow with them as an o/p. Discussed with the daughter the incidental finding on CTAP of possibly loose pedicle screws at S1. She said that she vaguely remembers hearing about it in the past. She said that although the patient doesn't want surgery she would like maybe getting a second opinion or further workup as an outpatient. Gave her information for NSG.          Chest discomfort: Patient described the chest discomfort beneath her left breast without associated symptoms. Suspect that this was referred/associated with the pain in her abdomen. EKG was without acute ischemic changes. Troponin negative ×3. She had no recurrence of this discomfort.         Hypoxia: She likely has underlying OSA as she is primarily desaturating at night. O/p sleep study recommended. Follow up with PCP.          She was recommended discharge to SNF but declined placement at this time. She will go home with HHC.

Of note, patient had another recent admission there from 12/16 through 12/23/2020 for bilateral pneumonia and treated with a course of IV cefepime and levofloxacin after discharge (14 days total). His symptoms on presentation this time were shortness of breath, cough and weakness. He is usually on 6 L of oxygen at baseline and increases to 8 L and his oxygen saturations were in the 60s.  Patient denied fever, chills, sweats, headache, dizziness, nausea or vomiting or diarrhea. W/u there was notable for a viral swab negative for COVID 19, flu, and RSV. CT scan showed worsening (compared to earlier admission) ground glass opacities on L lung. He was given one dose of vanc and cefepime for 7 days. His O2 requirement there fluctuated from 13 L -> 8 -> 10 L. Given the lack of improvement in his condition he was t/f to Presby for further management.   On arrival here he appears well. VS are normal, with him satting 98% on home O2 requirement of 6L (from 10 at OSH). He said that lower O2 makes him feel SOB but this was not a/b desaturation. He is tachypneic to the 30s.

Hospital Course   P.STE is a 61 year old man with a history of left single lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis on  9/22/2016 complicated by chronic lung allograft dysfunction with chronic hypoxic respiratory failure (baseline O2 requirement: 6LPM) and hospitalization at UPMC-McKeesport 12/16-12/23/2020 for pneumonia treated with Cefepime + Azithromycin then Levofloxacin, who was admitted because of worsening dyspnea with increase in O2 requirement to 10L since discharge to home. He presented initially at UPMC-McKeesport ED then transferred to PUH for further evaluation and management. CT Chest showed worsening groundglass opacities in the allograft lung prompting empiric Cefepime. Nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV2 and respiratory viruses. However, respiratory status continued to decline necessitating HFNC by 1/11. Pulm-Transplant impression was likely acute rejection in the setting of subtherapeutic levels and occurring in a chronically poor lung function from presumed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Prognosis was felt poor. Nevertheless, he was given empiric 3G  pulse Methylprednisolone with no improvement in his respiratory status.

Baseline OP-Neuro appt is tomorrow and I will meet with him to get ONSS consent.  Of note, at week 4 he had resumed alcohol use but was no longer smoking marijuana.

She was previously followed by Research Analyst (RA) Jessica Liu until Step 2 Phase End. Currently, she is in the Step 2 Continuation Phase, followed by RA Kathy Zhang.  During the participant's month-4 decision-support call on May 25th, 2020 at 3:22 PM (EST), the participant described being hospitalized around mid-April 2020. She reported having severe diarrhea due to food poisoning. She was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital for about 1 week and later stayed at a recovery center for about 4 weeks. She reported being discharged from the recovery center to go home on May 19th, 2020. She is currently a resident of a senior's home.

She reported that she did not stop her medications during and following the hospitalization event.  The study RA informed the study investigator Dr. Benoit Mulsant at 4:02 PM (EST) about the event and plans for SAE reporting. Upon further discussion, the SAE was appraised as unrelated to the study intervention, unexpected and of severe severity.

April 17th: The black spots persisted, and her daughter called the participant's ophthalmologist and left a voicemail.   April 21st: The black spots had expanded in her right eye and came a little net of dots. The ophthalmologist returned her call and scheduled to see the participant.   April 23rd: The participant's daughter called the ophthalmologist again to mention that the blackness had expanded to a quarter of the eye. The ophthalmologist said to come into the clinic, immediately.  April 24th: At the appointment, the ophthalmologist diagnosed that there is macular hole in the retina of both of her eyes, and the left eye appears worse in comparison to the right eye (which did not make sense to the participant). She was then referred to a different surgeon for a surgery for a later date.   April 28th: Participant woke up and the black spots expanded to half of her right eye. Her daughter took her straight to Sunnybrook Hospital, immediately. She was admitted in the ER and they did some scans and blood work.   April 29th: CT scans revealed that she had inflammation in her right eye (something that her ophthalmologist had missed). An urgent referral was made to a neuro-ophthalmologist, but they were not on-call (given COVID-19). The doctor managing her case in the ER suggested that the inflammation was high, but not something to worry about and the participant was discharged from the hospital  April 30th: Participant returned to Sunnybrook to see the neuro-ophthalmologist and he was shocked that she was discharged the day before and that her condition was much worse than what she was told. She was re-admitted on the 30th but at this point it was too late. She did not respond to the medications that she was given at the time (injections of Prednisone I believe)  May 1st: She lost full sight in her right eye. She began taking several medications including: Prednisone 80mg/day. Sulfatrim, Insulin, and Calcium Carbonate (she was also taking her regular medications: Xarelto, ferrous gluconate, Dexilant, Tylenol extra strength, Duloxetine 120mg, Lyrica 150mg, and Bupropion 300mg)  May 3rd: A biopsy revealed the macular hole in her left eye. She was slowly losing vision in her left eye as well.   May 6th: She was discharged from the hospital and pronounced as blind.

She will be followed up by her non-psychiatric care team next week.    RA found out about this SAE during a decision support call around 5:00-5:15pm EST on March 10th, 2020.  RA debriefed the incident with a Toronto site investigator Dr. Alastair Flint around 10:15am EST on March 11th, 2020 and with investigator Dr. Benoit Mulsant around 12:51pm EST. Dr. Mulsant, upon reviewing the participant's medication list with the RA, suspected furosemide as a likely influencing factor for the hypokalemia incident.    The SAE detailed report was drafted and given approval for submission around 4:17pm EST.     SAE Detailed Report (Participant: UT10136, Step 1, Acute Phase)  A 71 year old female provided consent for the OPTIMUM Study (Step 1) on November 19th, 2019. She was randomized to Augmentation with Aripiprazole on December 11th, 2019. She began the study medication on January 27th, 2020. This participant is currently in the acute phase of step 1.   During the participant's extra decision-support call on March 10th, 2020 at 5:01 PM (EST), the study staff (Research Analyst: Kathy Zhang) became aware that the participant was admitted to Lady Minto Hospital in Cochrane, Ontario on March 7th, 2020. The participant described that she was low on potassium as well as calcium, magnesium and other electrolytes. She described having problems with her heart monitor and having to stay in the hospital for care. She reported being well enough to leave the hospital on March 9th, 2020. The participant reported that her care team from Lady Minto Hospital will follow up with her next week.   The participant reported taking the following medications:  Psychiatric:  Aripiprazole 5mg, QD  Duloxetine 60mg, BID  Trazodone 50mg, PRN    Non-psychiatric:  Novorapid insulin (insulin aspart), as per sliding scale  Lantus insulin 50 units, QHS  Pepto bismol, PRN  Transdermal nitro patch 0.6mg/hr, QHS  Bisoprolol fumarate 10 mg, QAM  Atorvastatin 40 mg, QD  Aspirin 81 mg, QD for heart disease management  Pregabalin 150 mg, BID  Furosemide 40 mg, QAM for blood pressure management  Pantoprazole magnesium 40 mg, BID  Ticagrelor 90mg, BID    The study staff informed the study investigator Dr. Alastair Flint at 10:15 AM (EST) and about the event and plans for SAE reporting. The study staff contacted Dr. Benoit Mulsant at 12:51 PM (EST) about the SAE. Upon further discussion, Dr. Mulsant suspected furosemide as a likely factor influencing the participant's hypokalemia event. The SAE was appraised as unrelated to the study intervention, unexpected and of moderate severity. We do not believe the SAE changes the cost-benefit of the study interventions.    Because the participant is not a patient at CAMH, the study staff does not have access to her health records for her recent hospitalization. The study staff will verbally ask for the participant's consent during the next point of contact (i.e. scheduled extra decision-support call on March 23rd, 2020). When consent is obtained, the study investigator can access further details about the incident through ConnectingOntario (e-records system).

The participant's husband described that around 5 or 6pm ET on May 11th, 2021, the participant fell and hit her head, creating a lump on her forehead. To be safe, the husband called an ambulance to take her to Lady Minto Hospital, where she was admitted that same evening. At the time of the call, the husband mentioned that the participant was still in the hospital as they are continuing to run tests, and that she would be discharged the next day, May 13th. He has been in contact with her over the phone since being admitted to the hospital, and he reported that the participant is well and in good spirits.

She was randomized to Step 1 (augmentation with Aripiprazole) on January 7th, 2020. Currently, she is in the Step 1 Continuation Phase.   During the participant's OPTIMUM Step 1 Month 12 phone call on April 23rd, approximately 10:00AM (EST), she shared that she had a suicide attempt in February 2021. She described that in February (1 month after her month 8 call) her depression had worsened; she couldn't sleep, was losing track of the days and was alone for over a month and a half. One day in February (exact date unknown), she took all the sleeping pills (zopiclone, 7.5mg QHS) and benzodiazepines (clonazepam, 1.5mg QHS & 1mg BID) that she had on hand, wrote a note, and did not plan on waking up. She described this attempt as being very impulsive as she did not have a plan and it all happened very quickly. When she woke up the next morning, she went to the hospital as she felt unwell from the meds. She was not admitted to the hospital.  After her attempt, she spoke with her family physician and she created a contract that states she will not harm herself again. She mentioned that this attempt made her realize how deeply her death would impact her loved ones, and that she does not have a desire to attempt again. Additionally, her family physician is now prescribing her medication weekly through blister packs to prevent another overdose.  During the SAE and in the past few months, the participant has been taking vortioxetine (Trintellix) 20 mg/day and mirtazapine (45 mg/day).  The study RA (Hailey Wright) informed the study investigators Drs. Benoit Mulsant, Daniel Blumberger, and Alastair Flint at 12:30PM (EST) about the event.   This AE was appraised as unrelated to the study intervention, unexpected, and of severe severity. We do not believe this AE changes the cost-benefit of the study interventions.

Kim), recurrent VTE on Eliquis, Epilepsy (was on Keppra until 2011) and DM2 that presents with 6 weeks of arm and leg twitching and altered mental status.     Patient was brought in by daughter and was initially very sleepy in ED. Per daughter, she noticed personality changes in the past couple of weeks and has been more lethargic/sleeping more and complained of arm twitching. Neurology and Neurosurgery were consult for c/f progressive intracranial pathology or seizure activity.      Neurology saw that patient in the ED, who noted that these bilateral arm twitching is worse when she uses her arms and causes her to spill things; these are not similar to her old seizures. Patient also states that she has blurry vision that comes and goes. Per daughter in ED there is also some concern for urinary and fecal incontinence in recent weeks. Stat EEG was performed in ED; intermittent bilateral twitching movements were captured but no EEG correlates were seen with these movements. Per Neurology, this is likely multifactorial in the setting of Lithium toxicity (started 8 weeks ago as part of a clinical trial per patient) with AKI and UTI.      Neurosurgery also saw patient in ED. Noted that she had no new focal neurologic deficits nor acute changes on head CT. Will discuss elective operative planning with Dr. Kim, but noted it was unlikely during this admission and requested brain Mri with brain tumor protocol.     Patient states she started lithium ~8 weeks ago as part of a clinical trial. Per research note on 2/21/19, patient is enrolled in OPTIMUM study for treatment resistent depression. She was started on Cymbalta 90mg + Lithium 300mg for her mild depression (PHQ-9). She states the last time she had a level checked was around a month ago.     Patient today denies F/C, N/V, CP, abdominal pain. She states she has intermittent SOB for which she uses 2L O2 at home as needed. She also states she had chronic diarrhea. She denies numbness/tingling or acute weakness in any of her extremities. She does endorse dysuria recently.      Discharge Instructions:    As recommended by the psychiatry team, we recommend stopping your Lithium until you are able to follow up as an outpatient as it was most likely the cause of your altered mental status and muscle twitching (in conjunction with your urinary tract infection.) The inpatient psychiatry consult team will be in touch with your outpatient psychiatrist to update them on your admission. We also held other sedating medications like gabapentin and temazepam while your mental status and kidney function improved.      For your urinary tract infection, you will need to take cefdinir 300mg for 2 doses tomorrow (take 1 tablet in the morning and one in the evening), and you will have completed your antibiotic regimen for this UTI.",Resolved,"Hospital Course:    #Myoclonic Jerks: Patient's history and clinical presentation felt to be most consistent with myoclonic jerks 2/2 lithium toxicity. She was seen by neurology who ruled out a seizure with EEG (captured myoclonic movements but no EEG correlates) and exam. She was seen by neurosurgery who ruled out increased size of her recurrent meningioma as cause of her presentation; HCT without acute intracranial abnormality and MRI with interval increase in size of meningioma but no mass effect. Patient was then seen by psychiatry who followed her throughout admission. Neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, and primary medicine team were all in agreement that most likely etiology is lithium toxicity, and while she had therapeutic lithium levels, these did not reflect her peak level and her symptoms improved as they trended down (1.1 --> 0.9 --> 0.8). Patient's home lithium was held during admission with resolution of myoclonic jerks and marked improvement in mental status. Psychiatry recommended holding lithium and gabapentin for now as they discuss her treatment further with her outpatient psychiatrist.     #Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: Patient presented with AOx2 with improvement to AOx4 following 1L LR and 1 dose of CTX. Most likely toxic metabolic in etiology 2/2 polypharmacy (duloxetine, lithium, gabapentin, Percocet) and UTI. Patient's home gabapentin 800mg QHS and temazepam 15mg QHS were held; she was continued on her home Percocet (but half of her home dose) for chronic, severe headaches of unclear etiology. Patient's mental status markedly improved by hospital day 1 and she was discharged home with instructions to stop taking the gabapentin 800mg until she follows-up with pain management, who prescribes her pain meds.      #UTI: Patient was started on empiric IV CTX 1g qD in the ED, which was continued once she was on the floor. Urine culture positive for E coli; sensitivities pending. Patient discharged home on cefdinir 300mg PO BID for 1 day. She remained afebrile throughout admission.      #AKI: Patient presents with Cr of 1.2 with baseline 0.9-1.1. Most likely prerenal azotemia in setting of nausea and emesis. Improved to 0.91 with IVF.      #T2DM: Patient has history of T2DM on home metformin 1000mg BID with most recent HbA1C 7.9 (03/21/19), BG 160 on arrival. She was managed with QID accuchecks and placed on a LDSSI as well as a diabetic diet. Her blood sugars ranged from 106 to 164 while inpatient and she did not require any insulin.      #Recurrent VTE: Patient with history of PE (2009) following first meningioma resection and recent saddle PE and R DVT (03/2019), currently on apixaban 5mg BID for a total of 3 months. CT PE in ED without e/o acute PE. She was continued on her home apixaban 5mg BID and coagulation panel was wnl.      #Depression: Patient has a history of resistant/refractory depression with multiple treatment failures. She was followed by psychiatry while inpatient with recommendations to stop taking the lithium at discharge, continue her home duloxetine 90mg qD, and to follow-up outpatient for further management. Patient and daughter were advised to find a therapist for patient - daughter will call insurance company to see which therapists are covered and will take her mother to appointments.      #Meningioma: Patient is followed by neurosurgery with planned repeat resection this year. HCT showed postsurgical changes and residual/recurrent meningioma (R frontal & temporal lobes). She was followed by neurosurgery while inpatient with MRI W/WO contrast showing interval increase in size of dural-based right clinoid/greater sphenoid wing meningioma.
